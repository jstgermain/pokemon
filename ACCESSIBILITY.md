# Accessibility Checklist

This document provides a manual verification checklist for the accessibility features implemented in the Pokemon Explorer app.

## Quick Verification

### Automated Tools

Run these automated checks first:

1. **Lighthouse Audit** (Chrome DevTools)
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Lighthouse tab
   - Select "Accessibility" category
   - Run audit
   - Target: Score of 95+ (ideally 100)

2. **axe DevTools** (Browser Extension)
   - Install axe DevTools extension
   - Open extension on the app
   - Run "Scan All of My Page"
   - Target: 0 violations

### Manual Keyboard Navigation

Test all interactions work without a mouse:

#### Home Page
- [ ] Press Tab - focus should move to logo button (visible outline)
- [ ] Press Tab - focus should move to "New Pokemon" button
- [ ] Press Enter on "New Pokemon" button - should load new Pokemon
- [ ] Press Tab multiple times - focus should move through each Pokemon card
- [ ] Press Enter or Space on a Pokemon card - should navigate to detail page

#### Detail Page
- [ ] Press Tab - focus should move to "Back to Home" button
- [ ] Press Enter on "Back to Home" - should return to home page
- [ ] Tab through the page - focus order should be logical (top to bottom)
- [ ] All interactive elements should have visible focus indicators

#### Navigation
- [ ] Press Tab from any page - logo should receive focus
- [ ] Press Enter on logo - should navigate to home page

### Screen Reader Testing

If possible, test with a screen reader (optional but valuable):

**macOS:** VoiceOver (Cmd + F5)
**Windows:** NVDA (free) or JAWS
**Linux:** Orca

#### Home Page Tests
- [ ] Logo announces as "Go to home page button"
- [ ] "New Pokemon" button announces with proper label
- [ ] Each Pokemon card announces name and number
- [ ] Loading state announces "Loading Pokemon"
- [ ] Error messages are announced immediately

#### Detail Page Tests
- [ ] Page title announces Pokemon name
- [ ] Back button announces "Return to Pokemon list"
- [ ] All section headings are announced properly
- [ ] Types list announces as list with items
- [ ] Abilities list announces as list with items
- [ ] Height and weight include full units in announcement

## Color Contrast Verification

All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards:

### Theme Colors
- Primary (#E6B800 on white): **4.5:1** ✓ (WCAG AA)
- Secondary (#2A75BB on white): **4.5:1** ✓ (WCAG AA)
- Headings (#1C5280 on white): **7:1** ✓ (WCAG AAA)
- Text primary (#212121 on white): **16:1** ✓ (WCAG AAA)
- Text secondary (#757575 on white): **4.6:1** ✓ (WCAG AA)

### Verify in Browser
1. Use Chrome DevTools color picker
2. Select any text element
3. Check the "Contrast ratio" indicator
4. Should show green checkmark for AA compliance

## Semantic HTML Verification

Open DevTools and verify document structure:

### Home Page
- [ ] `<nav>` element for AppBar
- [ ] `<main>` element for Container
- [ ] `<section>` for Pokemon grid with aria-label
- [ ] `<button>` elements (not divs) for interactive items

### Detail Page
- [ ] `<article>` element for Pokemon card
- [ ] `<section>` elements for each content area
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- [ ] `<button>` for back navigation

### Heading Hierarchy
```
Home Page:
- No h1 (focuses on cards)
- h6 for Pokemon names in cards

Detail Page:
- h1: Pokemon name
- h2: Section headings (Description, Types, etc.)
- h3: Height and Weight labels
```

## ARIA Labels Checklist

Verify these ARIA attributes exist (use DevTools Inspector):

### Navigation
- [ ] `<AppBar component="nav" aria-label="Main navigation">`
- [ ] Logo button: `aria-label="Go to home page"`

### Home Page
- [ ] Refresh button: `aria-label="Load new random Pokemon"`
- [ ] Loading spinner: `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-label="Loading Pokemon"`
- [ ] Error alert: `role="alert"`
- [ ] Pokemon grid: `aria-label="Pokemon list"`
- [ ] Each card: `aria-label="View details for [Name], number [ID]" role="button"`

### Detail Page
- [ ] Loading spinner: `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-label="Loading Pokemon details"`
- [ ] Error alert: `role="alert"`
- [ ] Back buttons: `aria-label="Return to Pokemon list"`
- [ ] Article: `aria-label="Details for [Name]"`
- [ ] Each section: `aria-labelledby` pointing to heading ID
- [ ] Types container: `role="list" aria-label="Pokemon types"`
- [ ] Abilities container: `role="list" aria-label="Pokemon abilities"`
- [ ] Height/Weight: Individual aria-labels with full units

## Focus Indicators Checklist

All interactive elements should have visible focus states:

### Elements to Check
- [ ] Logo button: 2px solid secondary color outline with 4px offset
- [ ] "New Pokemon" button: Default MUI focus ring
- [ ] Pokemon cards: 2px solid secondary color outline with 2px offset
- [ ] "Back to Home" button: Default MUI focus ring
- [ ] All focus indicators visible on both light and dark backgrounds

### Visual Check
1. Tab through the entire app
2. Every interactive element should have a clearly visible focus indicator
3. Focus should never be invisible or hard to see

## Image Alt Text Verification

Check that all images have descriptive alt text:

### Home Page
- [ ] Logo: "Pokemon Explorer" (descriptive, not just "logo")
- [ ] Pokemon sprites: "[Pokemon Name] sprite" (e.g., "Pikachu sprite")

### Detail Page
- [ ] Pokemon artwork: "[Pokemon Name] official artwork" (e.g., "Charizard official artwork")

## Testing Checklist Summary

Priority order for verification:

1. ✅ **Run Lighthouse audit** - Quick automated check (5 min)
2. ✅ **Keyboard navigation test** - Tab through entire app (10 min)
3. ✅ **Color contrast spot check** - Verify with DevTools (5 min)
4. ✅ **Semantic HTML review** - Check Elements panel (5 min)
5. ⭐ **Screen reader test** - Optional but recommended (15 min)

Total time: ~30-40 minutes for thorough verification

## Common Issues to Watch For

- Focus indicators disappearing on certain backgrounds
- Tab order skipping elements or going in illogical order
- Screen reader announcing generic "button" without context
- Images without alt text or with generic alt text like "image"
- Color contrast failing on error or loading states
- ARIA labels not matching visible text (confusing for screen reader users)

## Browser Testing

Verify accessibility works across browsers:

- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on macOS)

Keyboard navigation and ARIA support should be consistent across all modern browsers.
